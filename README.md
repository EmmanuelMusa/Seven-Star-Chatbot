# COMPANY CHATBOT

## Introduction

This project was initiated as a demo to showcase the operation of a chatbot on my company site. The project leverages data tailored towards the operation of the company, Seven Star Consultants Limited.

## Approach

A pytorch model is used to train data tailored towards the operations of Seven Star Consultants Limited. The source code for the company site was used for the front end interface where the chatbot is hosted, while Flask is used at the backend.
Images of the deployment can be seen in the 'sample_pictures' folder.
